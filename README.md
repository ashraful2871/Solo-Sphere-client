# Challenges Faced

During this project, I faced several challenges, such as implementing JWT tokens and performing CRUD operations. When I first started implementing tokens, I got confused with the GET and POST methods. After exploring the documentation, I managed to fix the issue. However, after deploying the project, I realized that although the token was added after logging in, it wasn't removed after logging out. After much troubleshooting, I found that the issue was caused by the token being stored server-side with the POST method and client-side with the GET method. Once I fixed this, everything worked perfectly. I also faced some difficulties while working with CRUD operations, especially with changing the status. I had to figure out how to change the status when clicked, but after some effort, I was able to successfully implement it. In the end, I managed to resolve all the issues and complete the project successfully.
